This is a repo created when I wanted to get notifications for school closure or covid count in Ontario last year.  As this is important for me to know as I had kids in school.  However, the data was alway delayed by a few days, so it never really was useful in the end.

Assuming you have set up aws and configured the aws command line, you should be simply be able to run:
```bash
serverless deploy
```
